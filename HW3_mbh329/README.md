#### Details on the Assignment: ##### I had tremendous help with the assignment 1st from Ilyas; he helped me work out the mistakes that I had made before and without him I would have been a fish out of water. For the 2nd and 3rd assignments, I had help from Andrew Hill who basically pulled me through the two assignments and for that I am very grateful. These two gentlemen made the utmost effort to help me understand what was going on and the fact I have any idea what is going in is due to them.
