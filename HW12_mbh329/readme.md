Assignment 1- for assignment 1, I had help from Pablo mandiola who helped me (after he was done with his assignment) with flattening and setting up my data for the fourier transform and  minor tweaks to my plotting.Cyrus B helped me with the loop to iterate over the npumy array in my plot.  Also i used code from F Bianco's Fourier UI noteobook located in her repo for plotting.


Assnighnment 2- I worked primarily with Katherine V on the assignment. She was very helpful with setting up the loops to read in the data and put them in the PUIdata folder.
Cyrus blankminship helped with code for plotting the clusters in a a time series and without that id still be doing this homework. 
Sam burns and I talked a lot about the concepts behind the data and how to interpret our results: "Without a story what are we even doing."
