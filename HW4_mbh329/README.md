### For assignment 1
I plotted 5 different distributions (Chi-Squared, Normal, Poisson, Binomial, and Geometric) on individual scatter plots and histograms to showcase their relationship to the Central Limit Theorem and the Law of Large Numbers. Finally, I created a histogram that transposed the 5 distributions on top of one another. 

### For assingment 2
I used CitiBike data from August 2018 to compare the percentage of Subscribers vs Customers who utlize CitiBike during peak hours. 

### For assignment 3
I used the Z test to see how the implementation of a new bus line would influence commute time.
