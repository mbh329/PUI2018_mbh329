For assignment 1, I primarily worked alone with some help from Mark Bauer to clarify the deliverable at the end of the assignment.

For assignment 2,  I had loads of help from Pablo Mandiola, Sam Burns who helped me with a lot of the statistical analysis of the assn. like how to get a proper fit with a line and pieces of code that i don't know how to complete at this stage in my coding life. Yavuz helped me with scaling the plots and using sci notation. Mark Bauer helped me with some conceptual stuff concerning liklihood ratios. I was very close to getting the dof part but couldn't finish before the deadline
