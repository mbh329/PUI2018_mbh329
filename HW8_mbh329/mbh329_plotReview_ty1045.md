### Clarity
This graph is really clear and it conveys the information effectively. I can clearly distinguish between areas and I can
tell which area has a higher percentage. One suggestion is probably consider putting an axis label indicating the scale.
That would be great as the audience can tell which color represents which level.
### Esthetic
I like the color. One way to improve it is to choose more advanced color. Probably you can consider using rgb scale or the hex
color scale to make use of more beautiful and advance color.
### Honesty
Yes this graph perfectly convey the ideas and data without deforming it. I really like how this graph is generated.
