"MOTIVATION:
There is a known connection between school performance and the environment that a child is exposed to, including environmental conditions that may affect health, exposure to violence which affects stress level, and socioeconomic features, including income, which may determine the ability of a student to get help. Nonetheless, the modeling of school performance is difficult, as measures of performance may be biased and environmental features hard to measure.

In spite of that, I would like you to try and model performance, measures through the SAT score, of NYC students as a function of exposure to crime, measured through reports of crimes in school, living conditions, measured through the incidence of respiratory and drug related issues in the area, and optionally income.

The analysis is at the PUMA level. All data are accessible through NYC open data, the NY state open data portal (NY.gov), or my CARTO account. Remember the general rules and recommendations"
