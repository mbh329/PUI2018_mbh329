For assingment 1, I had a lot of help from many generous colleagues who helped me with lots of code that I would not have been able to write. 
Cyrus Blankminship gave me some code relating to the first section of this assignment specifically the loop that created the time series analysis. 
for event detection, I did most of it on my own (with the help of Biancos UI NB) but had a little help from P Mandiola to extract the actual date. 
For the second section of this assn, I had help from P mandiola, a lot of help from k cauley and some help from ilyas as well who was kind enough to show us some alternate ways of doing it. 
I was able to help Manrique in assignment with the np.where function. Many people tried to help me but i was a bit lost throughout this assignment. Hip hip hooray!

For assignment 2, I did it primarily by myself but P mandiola helped me get actual results which I am very grateful for. Thank you kind sir.

Caption: Figure 1: This choropleth map shows the percentage (by area) of NYCHA owned property within Community Districts. The lighter areas on the map have the higher, the higher percentage of NYCHA housing by area while the white labels are null. Overlayed on top (in blue) is the location polygons of actual NYCHA property.

Reviews
Clarity: Lack of xlabel, ylabel and legends makes the plot really hard to understand at first glimpse
Esthetic:
The title can be split into two lines to make it look better
The colors is not chosen appropriately. I would recommend colors used in HW7 as a reference
Honesty: In general, the visualization is honest

Clarity
This graph is really clear and it conveys the information effectively. I can clearly distinguish between areas and I can tell which area has a higher percentage. One suggestion is probably consider putting an axis label indicating the scale. That would be great as the audience can tell which color represents which level.

Esthetic
I like the color. One way to improve it is to choose more advanced color. Probably you can consider using rgb scale or the hex color scale to make use of more beautiful and advance color.

Honesty
Yes this graph perfectly convey the ideas and data without deforming it. I really like how this graph is generated.
