THE 1st assignment for my review was done on my own.

The second assignment was done with the help of Professor Bianco who provided code for fitting my lines, Ilyas who helped me with an error I had regarding my error function and helped me refine steps 6 + 7 , and Cyrus helped with code for my initial plot which paved the way for other code that followed.

the 3rd assignment i got help from yavuz with the data wrangling section concerning dropping rows. Cyrus helped me figure out how to plot.
